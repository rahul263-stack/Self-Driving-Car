# IMPORTANT 
Absolutely, under NO circumstance, one should ever pilot a car using computer vision software trained with this code (or any home made software for that matter). It is extremely dangerous to use your own self-driving software in a car, even if you think you know what you're doing, not to mention it is quite illegal in most places and any accidents will land you in huge lawsuits.

This code is purely for research and statistics, absolutley NOT for application or testing of any sort.So Please do not apply to any of your application .Meant for only college project.

# Procedure for using 
Download the [dataset]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view) and extract into the repository folder
You can use udacity self driving dataset also depending on what suits you

Use `python train.py` to train the model

Use `python run.py` to run the model on a live webcam feed

Use `python run_dataset.py` to run the model on the dataset

To visualize training using Tensorboard use `tensorboard --logdir=./logs`, then open http://0.0.0.0:6006/ into your web browser.
