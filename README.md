#Self Driving Car Uaing Tensorfolw
This project is implementaion of End to end Learning for self driving ca research paper by nvidia

Requirments :

tensorflow >2
python 3.5>
open cv
scipy


This code is purely for research and statistics, absolutley NOT for application or testing of any sort.do not use  it on computer vision software trained with this code

# How to Use
Download the [dataset]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view) and extract into the repository folder if u want u can use other  data sets also
You can use udacity self driving dataset also depending on what suits you
python train.py - To train this model

python run.py - Use this to run the program on a live cam feed.

`python run_dataset.py`  - use this to run the program on datasets

To see visual training
 `tensorboard --logdir=./logs`, then open http://0.0.0.0:6006/ into your web browser
